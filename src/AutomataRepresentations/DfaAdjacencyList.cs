    /// Adjacency-list of pairs (a, Î´(p, a)) defined for every state a in Q. The alphabet does not have to be indexable,

    /// state associated to each adjacency list (the most frequently occurring target of a given adjacency list is
    /// an obvious choice as default for this adjacency list). We have chosen the error state as the default state.

    /// Advantages:
    ///   - The alphabet does not have to indexable
    ///   - The alphabet does not have to be defined as fixed in advance
    ///   - Only transitions of trimmed DFA need to be in RAM
    /// Disadvantage
    ///    - Slower transition function, means slower recognize algorithm
