    // Valid Items and Prefixes
    // ========================
    // Definition: A marked production A ‚Üí Œ±‚Ä¢Œ≤ is a _valid_ LR(0) item for a string Œ¥Œ± in V‚àó if
    //      S‚Ä≤ ‚àó‚áí Œ¥Av ‚áí Œ¥Œ±Œ≤v = Œ≥Œ≤v
    // If such a derivation holds in G, then Œ≥ = Œ¥Œ± in V‚àó is a valid prefix.
    //
    // Definition: We say that 'Œ≥ = Œ¥Œ± _accesses_ the state' q containing A ‚Üí Œ±‚Ä¢Œ≤. This is often written
    //        * Œ≥ accesses q
    //        * s0 --Œ≥--> q
    //        * q = [Œ≥]
    //        * In state q we have pushed states that spell out Œ≥ onto the stack, therefore we have pushed Œ≥ onto that stack
    //
    // The transitions of the DFA van can be analyzed via splitting the valid prefixes into transitions
    // A pair ([Œ¥],X) in Q √ó V is a transition if and only if Œ¥X is a valid prefix. If this is the
    // case, then [Œ¥X] is the state accessed upon reading Œ¥X, thus the notation [Œ¥X] also implies (we
    // always assume when writing [Œ¥X] that Valid(Œ¥X) is not the empty set) a transition from [Œ¥] on X,
    // into [Œ¥X]. This is written [Œ¥]--X-->[Œ¥X], and we say that [Œ¥X] is accessed from [Œ¥] on the path X,
    // where |X|=1). The notation can be extended to non-singleton paths, where [Œ¥Œ±] is accessed from [Œ¥]
    // on a path equal to Œ±.
    //
    // The set of valid items for a given string Œ≥ in V‚àó is denoted by Valid(Œ≥). Therefore Valid(Œ≥) denotes a state of
    // the LR(0) automaton also called an LR(0) item set.
    // Two strings Œ¥ and Œ≥ are equivalent if and only if they have the same valid items.
    // The valid item sets are obtained through the following computations:
    //
    // The function Kernel(Œ≥X) yields the kernel items (aka kernel items) reached by a transition on symbol X from the
    // state Valid(Œ≥):
    //
    //      Kernel(Œµ) = {S‚Ä≤ ‚Üí ‚Ä¢S$}                                      (base case for kernel items)
    //      Kernel(Œ≥X) = {A ‚Üí Œ±X‚Ä¢Œ≤ | A ‚Üí Œ±‚Ä¢XŒ≤ ‚àà Valid(Œ≥)}              (induction/transition step for kernel items)
    //
    //      Valid(Œ≥) = Kernel(Œ≥) ‚à™ Closure(Valid(Œ≥)).                  (closure of item set: from kernel items to closure items)
    //
    // where the function Closure(I) yields the result of adding closure items to the kernel items of a LR(0) item set I.
    //
    //      Closure(I) = {B ‚Üí ‚Ä¢œâ | A ‚Üí Œ±‚Ä¢BŒ≤ ‚àà I}
    //
    // NOTE: Since states are uniquely determined by their sets of kernel items, the test to see if a new state have
    // been found does not require that the Closure function be applied to the kernel items first.
    //
    // LR(0) Automaton
    // ===============
    // LR(0) automaton is a deterministic pushdown automaton (DPDA) that uses equivalence classes on valid
    // prefixes as their stack alphabet Q. We therefore denote explicitly states of a LR parser as q = [Œ¥],
    // where Œ¥ is some valid prefix in the state q reached upon reading this prefix (s0 --Œ¥--> q is therefore
    // denoted q = [Œ¥]). For instance, in the automaton of Figure 1a, state q2 is the equivalence class {S},
    // while state q8 is the equivalence class described by the regular language Aa‚àóa.
    //
    // LALR(1) Automaton
    // =================
    // The LALR(1) lookahead set of a reduction using A ‚Üí Œ± in state q is
    //      LA(q, A ‚Üí Œ±) = {a ‚àà T | S‚Ä≤ *‚áí Œ¥Aav ‚áí Œ¥Œ±av and q = [Œ¥Œ±], v ‚àà N*}
    // That is given the DFA has reached a state [Œ¥Œ±] containing the reduce item A ‚Üí Œ±‚Ä¢, where we consider to
    // reduce and backtrack to the predecessor state p (after popping |Œ±| states/symbols of the stack),
    // because we know [Œ¥]--Œ±-->[Œ¥Œ±], we collect all terminal symbols that can follow the GOTO action (non-terminal)
    // transition on A, i.e. where [Œ¥Aa] can be accessed such that Œ¥Aav is a valid right-most sentential form.
    //

    // Goal: Recognize substrings of grammar symbols that can appear on the stack. The stack contents

    // ======================
    // If the existence of some item, I1, in some state implies the existence of another item, I2, either
    // in the same state (through the addition of completion/closure items) or in some other state (through the
    // state completion process), then the lookahead function applied to I2 yields a set which may contain
    // symbols determined by I1. This is called spontaneous generation of lookahead symbols.
    //
    // propagate
    // =========
    // In addition, it is possible that the set of lookahead symbols for I2 must include the entire set of
    // lookahead symbols for I1. In this case, the symbols are said to propagate from I1 to I2.
    //
    // The rules for spontaneous generation of symbols and propagation of symbols in the two possible
    // settings are as follows.
    //
    // Case 1 -- Closure Items
    // Suppose that state q contains an item I1, where the marker appears to the left of a nonterminal symbol.
    // That is, I1 has the form [A ‚Üí Œ±‚Ä¢XŒ≤]. The state must also contain one or more closure items with the form
    // [B ‚Üí ‚Ä¢œâ]. Let I2 be one such item.
    // The symbols which can follow the RHS of I2 must include the symbols which follow X in item I1, and the
    // symbols which can follow X in that item must include FIRST(Œ≤). In other words, a ‚àà FIRST(Œ≤) implies
    // a ‚àà LA(q, I2). In the terminology of the dragon book, the symbol a is spontaneously generated (by I1)
    // and must appear in the lookahead set of I2.
    // In addition, if Œ≤ is nullable and b ‚àà LA(q, I1), then b ‚àà LA(q, I2) must hold. This would be a case
    // of symbol b propagating from I1 to I2.
    //
    // Case 2 -- Kernel Items
    // Suppose that state q1 contains an item I1 with the form [A ‚Üí Œ±‚Ä¢XŒ≤]. There must necessarily be another
    // state q2 reached by a transition on symbol X from q1, where q2 contains a kernel item with the form
    // [A ‚Üí Œ±X‚Ä¢Œ≤]. In such a case, if a ‚àà LA(q1, I1) then a ‚àà LA(q2, I2). This is another example of propagation,
    // where symbol a propagates from I1 to I2.
    //
    // A simple algorithm to determine the lookahead sets can start by initializing all lookahead sets
    // to empty. Then it can make repeated passes over all items in all states adding spontaneously
    // generated symbols and propagated symbols to the sets. This iterative procedure can halt when
    // a pass fails to add any new symbols to any set. A faster version, would use a worklist so that
    // only items whose lookahead sets have changed participate in the next pass. Entries in the worklist
    // consist of (state, item)-pairs.
